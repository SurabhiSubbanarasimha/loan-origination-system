# Loan Origination Frontend

A lightweight Frontend Web App that allows borrowers to apply for loans and instantly view approval decisions and loan offers.  
It connects to a Spring Boot backend through REST APIs and demonstrates clean full-stack design with simple validation and API integration.

---

## What It Does
- Collects borrower details (name, address, email, SSN, income, debt, etc.)
- Validates inputs on the client side
- Sends data to the backend for decisioning
- Displays a clear result: **APPROVED** or **DENIED**, with loan offer details
